### About the Project
For my Django project, I aimed to deploy a web application using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. Specifically, I used Google Cloud Compute Engine to provision a virtual machine running a Linux-based operating system and installed Nginx and Gunicorn to handle web traffic and run the Django application.

To store my application's data, I used Google Cloud SQL, which is a fully managed relational database service. I also utilized Google Cloud Storage Buckets to store static files and media files, which are separate from the main application server.

Finally, I configured a custom domain name using a DNS provider, which allows users to access the website using a user-friendly and memorable URL.

Overall, by using GCP services such as Compute Engine, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage Buckets in conjunction with Nginx, Gunicorn, and DNS, I was able to successfully deploy a Django web application in a scalable and reliable environment.
